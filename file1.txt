Plagiarism is taking someone else's words and ideas and making them your own.

Plagiarism is a serious crime. In college, you will often fail your homework. If you plagiarize too often, you can get expelled from school.

Penalties vary outside the academy.
Getting caught plagiarizing will damage your reputation and you'll lose your job.

But you must not obey the law to avoid being caught. If you value original ideas, personal honesty, and academic research, you will want to avoid plagiarism.
