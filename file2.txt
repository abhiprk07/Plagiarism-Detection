Plagiarism is stealing other people’s words and ideas and passing them off as your own.

Plagiarism is a serious offense. At the university level it will usually get you an F on your assignment. If you plagiarize repeatedly you may even get kicked out of the institution.

Outside the academy, the penalties vary. Being caught plagiarizing certainly hurts your reputation and you might lose your job.

But you shouldn’t obey the law just to avoid getting caught. If you value original thought, personal integrity, and scholarly research, then you will naturally want to avoid plagiarism.
